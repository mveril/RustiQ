# RustiQ logical persistence format V1

This document specifies the storage-independent logical format used by RustiQ
scientific persistence. It does not specify a cache layout or archive container.

## Logical entries

- `manifest.json` is UTF-8 JSON and describes the format, producer, scientific
  identity and artifacts.
- `arrays/integrals/ao-eri.npy` is the AO electron-repulsion integral artifact.

Every artifact records its logical path, encoding, dtype, representation,
logical shape, basis-function count and a `sha256:<lowercase hex>` digest of the
complete payload bytes. Payload integrity is independent of its container.

## `rustiq-compact-eri-v1`

AO ERIs are a one-dimensional NPY array of IEEE-754 binary64 values. Object and
pickled arrays are forbidden. Readers must validate the dtype, rank, element
count and digest before scientific use. Both little- and big-endian binary64 NPY
payloads are readable; writers use the native binary64 dtype emitted by `npyz`,
and the dtype stored in the NPY header defines the payload endianness.

For `n` basis functions, define the symmetric pair index

```text
pair(i, j) = a(a + 1)/2 + b, where a = max(i, j), b = min(i, j).
```

Then define

```text
eri(mu, nu, lambda, sigma) = pair(p, q),
p = pair(mu, nu), q = pair(lambda, sigma).
```

The NPY value at that final index stores `(mu nu | lambda sigma)`. Its length is
`m(m + 1)/2`, where `m = n(n + 1)/2`. This is the stable ordering implemented by
`PairIndex` and `EriIndex`; the NPY shape alone never defines these semantics.

## `scientific-identity-v1`

The identity is SHA-256 over an explicit canonical byte stream, not serialized
Rust structs or JSON. Collections and strings are prefixed by unsigned 64-bit
big-endian lengths; integers are big-endian; floating-point values are their
IEEE-754 binary64 bits in big-endian order, with negative zero normalized to
positive zero.

The stream contains, in order:

1. identity and ERI representation identifiers;
2. ordered atoms: atomic number and coordinates in Bohr;
3. ordered effective AO data consumed by the ERI engine: shell center,
   normalized component angular momentum, primitive exponents and effective
   normalized coefficients;
4. Schwarz screening state, encoded distinctly as disabled or enabled with a
   positive finite threshold.

Producer version, paths, timestamps, compression and container metadata do not
participate in scientific identity.
